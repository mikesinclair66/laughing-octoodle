# AI‑Native Project Canvas

> **Purpose**: This document acts as the living memory of the project. It is optimized for continuous evolution, constraint awareness, and AI‑assisted reasoning.

## 1. Project Charter / North Star

### 1.1 Problem Statement
> _What real problem does this system exist to solve?_

**Placeholder:**
- The system exists to solve: `This platform enables developers to store the processes,
data, services, and systems of their project in order that they can have continuous
access to using this information to build out the phases of all their projects.`

---

### 1.2 Target Users
> _Who is this for? Be specific._

**Placeholder:**
- Primary users: `Software Developers, AI Agents`
- Secondary users: `Consultants, Project Managers, Business Owners`

---

### 1.3 Success Metrics
> _How do we know this worked?_

**Placeholder:**
- Success is achieved when:
  - `[measurable outcome]`
  - `[measurable outcome]`

---

### 1.4 Non‑Goals (Explicit Exclusions)
> _What this system will deliberately NOT attempt to do._

**Placeholder:**
- This system will NOT:
  - `[explicit non-goal]`
  - `[explicit non-goal]`

---

## 2. System Invariants & Constraints

> **Rule**: Anything written here is assumed true unless explicitly changed in the Change Log.

### 2.1 Technical Constraints

**Placeholder:**
- Backend technology: `[e.g., Spring Boot + MongoDB]`
- Frontend technology: `[e.g., Next.js / Vue / React]`
- Deployment environment: `[e.g., Docker + NGINX on Ubuntu]`

---

### 2.2 Operational Constraints

**Placeholder:**
- Performance budget: `[e.g., <200ms TTFB]`
- Availability target: `[e.g., 99.9%]`
- Scalability assumptions: `[e.g., max concurrent users]`

---

### 2.3 Architectural Invariants

**Placeholder:**
- The system must always:
  - `[invariant rule]`
  - `[invariant rule]`

---

## 3. Conceptual Model / Domain Language

> _These definitions are canonical. New terms must be added here._

### 3.1 Core Entities

**Placeholder:**
- **[Entity Name]**: `[precise definition]`
- **[Entity Name]**: `[precise definition]`

---

### 3.2 Key Relationships

**Placeholder:**
- `[Entity A]` relates to `[Entity B]` by `[relationship description]`

---

### 3.3 Canonical Vocabulary

**Placeholder:**
- "[Term]" means: `[exact meaning in this system]`
- "[Term]" does NOT mean: `[common misunderstanding to avoid]`

---

## 4. Architecture & Boundaries

> _Define where responsibilities live and where they never cross._

### 4.1 System Components

**Placeholder:**
- Component: `[name]`
  - Responsibility: `[what it owns]`
  - Does NOT handle: `[explicit exclusions]`

---

### 4.2 Integration Points

**Placeholder:**
- External system: `[name]`
- Interaction type: `[sync / async / event / API]`
- Data exchanged: `[high-level description]`

---

### 4.3 Forbidden Couplings

**Placeholder:**
- `[Component A]` must never directly depend on `[Component B]`

---

## 5. Capabilities & User Flows

> _Describe behavior, not implementation._

### 5.1 User Capabilities

**Placeholder:**
- Users can:
  - `[capability statement]`
  - `[capability statement]`

---

### 5.2 System Guarantees

**Placeholder:**
- The system guarantees:
  - `[guarantee or rule]`
  - `[guarantee or rule]`

---

### 5.3 Edge Cases & Failure Modes

**Placeholder:**
- If `[failure condition]`, then the system:
  - `[expected behavior]`

---

## 6. Change Log & Rationale

> **Rule**: No significant change occurs without an entry here.

### 6.1 Recorded Changes

**Placeholder Entry:**
- **Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
- **Change Summary:** `[what changed]`
- **Reason:** `[why the change was necessary]`
- **Invalidated Assumptions:** `[if any]`
- **Affected Sections:** `[list section numbers]`

---

### 6.2 Open Questions / Pending Decisions

**Placeholder:**
- `[question or decision still unresolved]`

---

## 7. Meta: How to Use This Document

- This document is **living** and expected to change.
- When in doubt, update constraints before adding features.
- If two sections conflict, **System Invariants win** until explicitly changed.
- AI assistants should treat this document as the source of truth.
